# GravitizeHUD
Originaly a minor edit, GravitizeHUD is my personal hud and pet project for Team Fortress 2.

Taking [HypnotizeHUD](https://github.com/Hypnootize/hypnotizehud) has a base, I've aimed to keep its color scheme and general aesthetic while adjusting and replacing elements to fit my personal preferences, having taken insperation from many other huds. Most of my testing has been with 1440p, so other resolutions may have some minor misalignments.
